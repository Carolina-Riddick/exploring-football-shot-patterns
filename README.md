## Exploring Football Shot Patterns: A Data-Driven Analysis

#### This notebook presents an exploratory data analysis of football shooting behaviour using publicly available StatsBomb data. The aim is to visualise and interpret shot patterns, identifying spatial and statistical trends that contribute to goal-scoring performance.

#### We analyse the spatial distribution of shots, their outcomes, and contextual variables such as shot distance, angle, and player involvement. Through a combination of data preprocessing, visual analytics, and statistical insights, the notebook highlights how data-driven methods can be applied to understand efficiency and decision-making in football.

#### This work demonstrates a practical approach to sports analytics, integrating data science techniques with domain knowledge to generate meaningful insights into on-field performance.
